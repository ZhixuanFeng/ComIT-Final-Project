# ComIT-Final-Project

Timoc is a card game that is playable on the browser.  It is designed to be played by
                        1-4 players in the same room, using their phones as controllers
                        and a TV as a shared display.
                        Players defeat incoming enemies by playing cards from their decks
                        and are rewarded with randomly generated cards to their collections.
                        Play decks are customizable and
                        cards can be traded in a market place.
